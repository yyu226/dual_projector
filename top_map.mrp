Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <startbufg>, driving the net,
   <hdmi_start>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: hdmi_start_goo_OR_86_o.A6; >
   < PIN: hdmi_start_DE_OR_88_o1.A5; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <startbufg.O>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net SYNC_VS is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 377 block(s) removed
  16 block(s) optimized away
 404 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
